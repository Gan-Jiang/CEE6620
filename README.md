I am the TA for CEE6620 (https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP16/class/CEE/6620) at 2017 Spring.  The repo is the assignments that I help design for the course. 

## homework 1
Implementations of three shortest path algorithms: (1) dijkstra's algorithm not using priority queue; (2) dijkstra's algorithm using priority queue; (3) A* algorihtm. All of the algorithms are tested on Manhattan Network to show the performance boost from one to another.
