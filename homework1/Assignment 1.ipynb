In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue). Here we can use a priority queue to store the unvisited nodes, and get the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue in each iteration. We want to use this data structure because in priority queue it will take O(log n) to put and remove an element. In a list, it will take O(n). This will make a large difference in practice when n is a large number. You do not need to implement your own priority queue, but instead you can use heapq package (https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html).
